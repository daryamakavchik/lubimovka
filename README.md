## Description
This landing page is a portfolio project created as an assignment for [Yandex.Practicum](https://practicum.yandex.com/web/ "Web Development Program"). 
"Lubimovka" is a nonprofit annual festival for Russian speaking playwrights from anywhere in the world. Every year Lubimovka holds a selection of new plays written by both beginners and recognized Russian-speaking authors. Its goal is to give voice to novice authors and make them heard.

The project was designed to practice teamwork and creating responsive layouts.
